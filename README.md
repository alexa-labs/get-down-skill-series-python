This repository is the companion guide for Amazon Alexa’s [5-part Twitch series](https://build.amazonalexadev.com/GetDownSkillShow_Registration.html) where hosts [Anna](https://twitter.com/Annamatroniks) and [Amit](https://twitter.com/amit) , a designer and voice developer build a skill called “Get Down” together. You can watch them on Twitch as they attempt to design, build, and make this amped up skill available on the Alexa Skill store.

After each show, we’ll make new documentation and code updates available here on GitHub, so you can follow along with them as they build the Get Down skill.

## Series Schedule

### Thursday, December 12, 2019
*Title:* Get Down Series Premiere<br>
*Description:* Join Anna and Amit on the pilot episode of the “Get Down” series as they work together to think of a mega-million-dollar Alexa skill idea. Okay, maybe that last part is just a bit exaggerated. They’re attempting to build an exercise skill that’s engaging and fun to keep users coming back for more. That’s pretty much the opposite of what happens to most workout plans. With the odds stacked against them, follow along to see whether they’ll get it built or go bust!

### Thursday, December 19, 2019
*Title:* Voice Design Best Practices<br>
*Description:* We’ll talk about how not to commit some UX design sins with a better approach to the voice design process. Just like writing for the silver screen, we’ll be scripting our dialog and starting to create storyboards for how we expect users to interact with our skill. Find out how the heck we're going to get down and design this funky thing.

Holiday Note: We're taking a holiday break on Twitch until the New Year. We'll resume the Get Down series in January. See you in 2020!

### Thursday, January 9, 2019
*Title:* Test Results from Our (Somewhat) Willing Participants<br>
*Description:* We're back with results from our test with actual humans who had absolutely no idea what they were getting into! We'll use the results to both figure out if our idea is okay, and fine-tune this before we throw ourselves into the code.

### Thursday, January 16, 2019
*Title:* How Do You Uproot a Couch Potato?<br>
*Description:* We’ve got the general idea of this easy to use exercise skill, but how do we get people coming back for more? We're going to make users want to Get Down all the time with different retention methods used often in gaming. Unlock rewards, shatter achievement records, and much more. We’ll decide what methods are right for this skill, along with how we’re going to document and build it in.

### Thursday, January 23, 2019
*Title:* A New Year to Get Down<br>
*Description:* We’re getting close to launch our skill, Get Down. For this skill, the new year is a prime time to get customers who are excited about exercising while they’re still hopeful about fulfilling their resolutions. In this episode, we’ll go over getting our skill ready for certification and publishing. Will we get our skill across the finish line in time? Or will skill publishing be our unfinished resolution?
