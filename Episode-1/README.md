### Episode 1 - Thursday, December 12, 2019

*Title:* Get Down Series Premiere

*Description:* Join Anna and Amit on the pilot episode of the “Get Down” series as they work together to think of a mega-million-dollar Alexa skill idea. Okay, maybe that last part is just a bit exaggerated. They’re attempting to build an exercise skill that’s engaging and fun to keep users coming back for more. That’s pretty much the opposite of what happens to most workout plans. With the odds stacked against them, follow along to see whether they’ll get it built or go bust!
